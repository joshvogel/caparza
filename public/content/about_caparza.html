		<p>We are just four working class guys that like to get together and rock our friggin' asses off!
			Definitely coming from strong punk and metal influences, we write songs that we would want to 
			hear if we were in the crowd. Guitar riffs and melodies that play off each other subtly, interweaving bass lines
			and a drummer that keeps things driving...and gang vocals...we can't forget the gang vocals; 
			because we want everyone to sing along.</p>

		<p>So please, take a listen to our music on the Media tab and decide for yourself if you like what we do. Then, come to one of
		   our shows and let us entertain you.  I think you'll be glad you did.</p>
