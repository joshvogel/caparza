		<p>Hello again everyone! Caparza is taking a little break from shows and we are
		   currently putting all of our efforts into writing new material.  By the end of
		   this month we should either have some new exciting songs to play for you or we'll
		   have all killed each other. We're really hoping for new songs.</p>
		   
		<p>To try and quench your Caparza thirsts during the break, checkout the recent videos 
		   in our new videos section.  Carl and Jeremy recently played the first "Acoustic Night"
		   at the Kraken and someone was nice enough to record it.  Videos are up, just click the Media
		   tab and select videos.</p>
		   
		<p>See you all real soon. ~Caparza</p>
